        <p class="Paragraph">Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun in our solar system and is known for its distinctive set of rings. It is the second-largest planet in our solar system, after Jupiter. Saturn is a gas giant planet and is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with traces of other elements.Saturn has a diameter of about 120,000 kilometers (75,000 miles) and a mass of approximately 95 times that of Earth. It has a very low density, which means that it is not a solid planet but is instead composed of gas and other materials.The most prominent feature of Saturn is its ring system, which consists of multiple bands of ice and rock particles that orbit the planet. These rings are incredibly thin, with a thickness of only a few hundred meters, and are believed to have formed from the debris of comets, asteroids, or other small objects that were captured by Saturn's gravity.Saturn has 82 known moons, the largest of which is Titan. Titan is notable for being the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, and it is also the only known body other than Earth to have stable bodies of surface liquid. This makes it a particularly interesting target for exploration and study.Saturn has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 and 2 missions, which provided us with much of our current knowledge of the planet and its moons. More recently, the Cassini spacecraft orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, providing unprecedented close-up views of the planet and its rings.</p>
