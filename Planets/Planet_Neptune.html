        <p class="Paragraph">Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is also the fourth largest planet by diameter and the third largest by mass.Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea, and it is often referred to as the "Ice Giant" because it is primarily composed of ice and rock. The planet has a very thick atmosphere, which is made up of mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane in Neptune's atmosphere gives the planet its blue color. Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that orbits its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation. Neptune also has a faint ring system, which was discovered in 1984 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.Neptune's distance from the Sun varies from 29.81 astronomical units (AU) at its closest to 30.33 AU at its farthest. One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). Neptune's year, or the time it takes to orbit the Sun, is about 165 Earth years, and its day, or the time it takes to rotate once on its axis, is about 16 hours.Neptune has only been visited by one spacecraft, the Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989.</p>
