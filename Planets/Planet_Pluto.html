        <p class="Paragraph">Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the outer solar system beyond Neptune. It was discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh and was considered the ninth planet of the solar system until 2006, when it was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).Pluto has a diameter of about 2,377 kilometers (1,476 miles), which is only about two-thirds the size of Earth's moon. It has a very elliptical orbit around the sun, and its distance from the sun varies from about 4.4 billion kilometers (2.7 billion miles) at its closest to 7.4 billion kilometers (4.6 billion miles) at its farthest.Pluto has a thin atmosphere primarily made up of nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. Its surface is covered in frozen nitrogen and methane, with patches of water ice and various dark, rocky areas.In 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft conducted a flyby of Pluto, providing the first close-up images and data of the dwarf planet. The mission revealed that Pluto is a complex and dynamic world with mountains, glaciers, and even a heart-shaped feature on its surface.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Why is Pluto no longer a planet?</h3>
        <p class="Paragraph">Pluto is not considered a planet because it fails to meet the criteria established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) for a celestial body to be classified as a planet. The IAU defines a planet as a celestial body that meets three criteria. Firstly, it must orbit the sun. Secondly, it must be massive enough to have become round due to its own gravity. Lastly, it must have "cleared its orbit" of other debris.Pluto does meet the first two criteria as it orbits the sun and is massive enough to have become round due to its own gravity. However, it fails to meet the third criteria as its orbit overlaps with Neptune's, and it is part of the Kuiper Belt, which contains many other objects similar in size and composition to Pluto.In 2006, the IAU redefined the criteria for what constitutes a planet, which resulted in Pluto being reclassified as a "dwarf planet." This decision was not without controversy, and some scientists and members of the public still consider Pluto to be a planet. However, according to the current scientific definition, Pluto is not considered a planet.</p>
