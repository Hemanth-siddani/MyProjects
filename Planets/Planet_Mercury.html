        <p class="Paragraph">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest planet to the Sun. It is named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury, and has a diameter of about 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles).Mercury orbits the Sun in just 88 Earth days, making a complete revolution around the Sun much faster than any other planet in our solar system. Because of its proximity to the Sun, Mercury's surface temperature can reach up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius) during the day and drop to -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius) at night.Mercury has a heavily cratered surface with many cliffs and escarpments. It also has a large iron core, which makes up about 70% of its mass. Mercury has no moons and no atmosphere to speak of, which means that it is constantly bombarded by solar winds and radiation.NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft was the first to visit Mercury in 1974, followed by the MESSENGER mission, which orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015. The European Space Agency's BepiColombo mission, which launched in 2018, is currently on its way to Mercury and is expected to arrive in 2025.</p>
