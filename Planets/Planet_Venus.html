        <p class="Paragraph">Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth's sister planet due to its similar size, mass, and composition. It is a terrestrial planet, meaning it is rocky and has a solid surface, unlike gas giants such as Jupiter or Saturn.Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and other gases. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is about 90 times greater than that of Earth, making it the most pressurized atmosphere of all the terrestrial planets. The thick atmosphere also creates a runaway greenhouse effect that heats up the surface to an average temperature of about 460 degrees Celsius, making it the hottest planet in the solar system.Venus has a slow rotation, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis, which is longer than its orbit around the Sun, which takes about 225 Earth days. This means that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus. Venus also has no moons or rings, and its surface is covered with numerous volcanic features and impact craters.Despite its harsh environment, Venus has been explored by several space missions, including the Soviet Venera and Vega missions, and NASA's Magellan mission, which mapped the planet's surface using radar. There are also plans for future missions to Venus, including NASA's VERITAS and DAVINCI+ missions, which aim to study the planet's geology and atmosphere in more detail.</p>
