        <p class="Paragraph">Planet Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the only planet in the solar system known to support life. It is a terrestrial planet with a solid surface and a dynamic interior that includes a molten iron core, a mantle, and a thin outer crust.The atmosphere of Earth is primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%) with small amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide, argon, and neon. This combination of gases allows for the development and sustenance of life on Earth by providing oxygen for breathing and regulating the temperature through the greenhouse effect.Earth has a unique system of tectonic plates that constantly move and interact with each other, leading to volcanic activity, earthquakes, and the formation of mountain ranges. It also has a magnetic field that helps protect the planet from harmful solar radiation.The planet is home to a diverse array of life forms, from microscopic bacteria to large animals such as elephants and whales. Human beings, the most intelligent species on the planet, have greatly impacted the environment through their activities, including deforestation, pollution, and climate change.The study of Earth and its processes is known as Earth science, which includes disciplines such as geology, oceanography, meteorology, and ecology. Understanding the planet and its processes is essential for developing sustainable practices and mitigating the impacts of human activity on the environment.</p>
