        <!-- <p class="Paragraph">The Solar System is a planetary system consisting of the Sun and various other celestial bodies orbiting around it. The Sun is the largest and most massive object in the Solar System, accounting for 99.86% of its total mass. The eight planets that orbit the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. In addition to the planets, the Solar System also contains dwarf planets such as Pluto, as well as numerous moons, asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.
            The Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old. The formation of the Solar System is believed to have started with the collapse of a molecular cloud, which eventually formed a spinning disk of gas and dust. The Sun formed at the center of this disk, while the planets and other objects formed from the material that remained in the disk.
            The eight planets of the Solar System are divided into two groups: the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and the outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). The inner planets are small, rocky, and have relatively short orbits around the Sun, while the outer planets are much larger, composed mostly of gas and ice, and have longer, more elliptical orbits.
            The study of the Solar System is an important field of astronomy and planetary science, and it provides insights into the formation and evolution of planets, the dynamics of orbits and gravitational forces, and the potential for life beyond Earth</p>
            <p>Our Solar System is made up of "Eight Planets" they are</p> -->
