        <p class="Paragraph">Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun in our solar system and is known for its unusual sideways orientation. It is classified as an ice giant planet, meaning that it is primarily composed of water, methane, and ammonia in the form of ice, with a small rocky core.Uranus has a diameter of about 50,000 kilometers (31,000 miles) and a mass approximately 14.5 times that of Earth. It has a faint ring system and 27 known moons, the largest of which is Miranda.The most notable feature of Uranus is its axial tilt, which is tilted at an angle of about 98 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. This gives Uranus a highly unusual "sideways" appearance, and also means that its poles are located where most other planets have their equators.Uranus was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel and was the first planet to be discovered with the use of a telescope. It was initially named "Georgium Sidus" after King George III, but the name Uranus, after the Greek god of the sky, was eventually adopted.Uranus has been visited by only one spacecraft, the Voyager 2 probe, which flew by the planet in 1986. This flyby provided us with our most detailed and comprehensive look at the planet to date.</p>
