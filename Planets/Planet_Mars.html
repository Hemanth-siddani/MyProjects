        <p class="Paragraph">Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance. It is a terrestrial planet, meaning it has a solid, rocky surface like Earth.Mars has a thin atmosphere consisting mainly of carbon dioxide, and its surface is covered by impact craters, mountains, valleys, and polar ice caps. There are also several prominent features on Mars, including the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the longest canyon in the solar system, Valles Marineris.There is evidence that liquid water existed on Mars in the past, and the planet is still being explored by various spacecraft and rovers in an effort to understand its geological history and potential for supporting life.</p>
